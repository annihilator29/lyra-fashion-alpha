# Email Authentication (DNS Configuration)
# ====================
# CRITICAL: Configure these DNS records with your domain provider for email deliverability
# These records prevent email spoofing and improve inbox placement
# Configured in Story 4.5: Email Notifications & Marketing Preferences
#
# 1. SPF Record (Sender Policy Framework)
#    Prevents unauthorized senders from using your domain
#    Type: TXT
#    Name: @
#    Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.net ~all
#
# 2. DKIM Record (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
#    Cryptographically signs emails to verify authenticity
#    Type: TXT
#    Name: resend._domainkey
#    Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY; t=s; s=email;
#    Note: Get YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY from Resend Dashboard > Domains > Authentication
#
# 3. DMARC Record (Domain-based Message Authentication)
#    Tells email providers what to do with unauthenticated emails
#    Type: TXT
#    Name: _dmarc
#    Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@lyrafashion.com
#    Note: Start with p=none, then upgrade to p=quarantine or p=reject after 2 weeks
#
# Verification Tools:
# - Mail-Tester.com: Check email authentication score (aim for 9+/10)
# - MXToolbox.com: Verify SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
# - Gmail MX Toolbox: Test deliverability to Gmail
